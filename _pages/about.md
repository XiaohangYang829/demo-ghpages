I study neural representation of 3D dynamic scenes. I am also interested in video processing and perception, including frame interpolation, action recognition, and optical flow estimation.

I recently completed my master degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Before that, I've joined 3DNR Group, Shanghai AI Lab, as an intern researcher to build a full-scene reconstruction platform for autonomous driving simulation and testing.
