This is a research project, and my master degree thesis is also based on it.

Frame interpolation can significantly improve the viewing effect of video. While the frame rates of most existing methods is still far from the real-time target. I design a new method which maintains most of the performance when improve at least 60% efficiency.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/teaser/interpolation_original.gif" title="original video frames" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/teaser/interpolation.gif" title="interpolated result" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    The motion is smoother.
